            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p><strong>Most people think living an “outdoor lifestyle” is mainly for fun and following a pursuit of passion. Or perhaps people are lazy and just an “outdoor bum.” While both of these can be true, whether you’re following your love of the outdoors or living the life of a ski bum, you can actually live longer by living your authentic outdoor lifestyle. Pretty cool, huh?
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Personally, an outdoor lifestyle can be interpreted in many different ways.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>It could be someone who just loves the outdoors and spends as much time as possible in the mountains and nature. It could be someone who lives as natural a lifestyle possible that is friendly for our ecosystem. It could be the extreme adventurer that is traveling to the ends of the Earth for climbing and mountain pursuits. It could be the average ski bum who is a powder seeker, chasing freshies all winter long.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Either way, what these people have in common is that because of their passion for the outdoors, they all experience increased happiness, less stress, better diets and more exercise than the average American – all factors that contribute to a longer life span.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Below, we’ll break each of these down and the positive impacts of your outdoor lifestyle can have on your actual years living on this Earth.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Exercise&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p><strong>A key part of outdoor recreation is exercise, whether it by hiking, trail running, climbing, kayaking or skiing.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Exercise has been proven over time to greatly improve your chances of living longer. The health benefits of exercise are endless, including reduced risk of heart disease, lower blood pressure, lower cholesterol levels and smaller waistlines.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>The New York Times talks about the Framingham Heart Study, which monitored the health and wellness of over 5,200 adults, that provided a risk factor index for each participant. Combined with the study from PLOS One from Australia, this took into consideration the amount of exercise each individual received into three categories: low, medium and high.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>This study proved that individuals who exercised regularly had a significant reduction in risk of dying from heart disease. In fact, the group who exercised the least had 6x the amount of risk of dying from heart disease than those in the highest exercise group.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Less Stress
</strong></p><p><strong>One of the main reasons why people spend time outdoors is that it’s peaceful and an escape from the typical day-to-day. This helps us let go of the daily stress our lives have, including hectic work schedules, home responsibilities and interpersonal tensions.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Besides heart disease, too much stress can have all sorts of negative impacts on your wellbeing. This includes, anxiety, depression, headaches and gastrointestinal problems.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>When you’re stressed, your body produces hormones adrenaline and cortisol, which increase blood pressure as well as alter your digestive and immune systems. These hormones can also cause you to gain weight.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>“If you ask what is the single most important key to longevity, I would have to say it is avoiding worry, stress and tension. And if you didn’t ask me, I’d still have to say it.” – George F. Burns
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Alleviating stress can help your body function better and feel better. Getting outdoors can help alleviate stress by increasing calming and peaceful activities.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Increased Happiness&nbsp;</strong><br><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Overall, we spend time outdoors because it makes us happy, right? Well, happiness has often been a link to increased longevity, so you’re on the right track to living longer!
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>In this article, CNN discusses a five-year study that shows older people are 35% less likely to die if they report feeling happy. This is huge! Who wouldn’t want a 35% leg up on life?
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>In addition, this study showed that the advance of happiness is more important than presence of negative emotions. Since the brain region that’s activated by happiness is also involved in blood-vessel functions, this is super important to live your life as happily as possible.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Better Diet&nbsp;</strong><br><strong></strong></p><p><strong>What we put into our bodies is essentially fuel. Don’t you want to put in the best fuel possible?
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Studies have shown that typically more active individuals have better diets and smaller waistlines. Therefore, healthier and better functioning bodies all around.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Outdoor recreators are no different. As we’re constantly in active situations and looking to fuel our bodies for adventure, individuals who spend time outdoors are typically looking for the best substances for the activity.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Studies have shown that certain diets can increase your chances for longevity. This includes many of the same foods that are helpful for sustained activity, including whole grains, fresh fruits, coffee and healthy proteins, such as fish and nuts.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>These are all heart healthy foods that can help your endurance in outdoor sports, but also live longer.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>So, now you know the longevity benefits of being outside so you don’t have to make excuses for skiing and climbing so much – it’s all helping you live longer!</strong></p></div>
